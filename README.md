# CalcMochaTest
a simple JS library for a calculator (mostly meant for a HTML interface) with mocha testing for a few of its methods. 
this project is just meant to be displayed as a simple example for a mocha JS presentation for my Software Arquitecture course at the University of Oviedo

you can find the presentation itself (in Spanish) in the Powerpoint uploaded to this repository
